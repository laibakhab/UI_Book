# Option 2 High OpEx: The "Ether" Lab (Cloud-Native)

Best for: Rapid deployment, or students with weak laptops.

## 1. Cloud Workstations (AWS/Azure)
Instead of buying PCs, you rent instances.
- **Instance Type:** AWS g5.2xlarge (A10G GPU, 24GB VRAM) or g6e.xlarge.
- **Software:** NVIDIA Isaac Sim on Omniverse Cloud (requires specific AMI).
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - **Instance cost:** ~$1.50/hour (spot/on-demand mix).
  - **Usage:** 10 hours/week × 12 weeks = 120 hours.
  - **Storage (EBS volumes for saving environments):** ~$25/quarter.
  - **Total Cloud Bill:** ~$205 per quarter.

## 2. Local "Bridge" Hardware
You cannot eliminate hardware entirely for "Physical AI." You still need the edge devices to deploy the code physically.
- **Edge AI Kits:** You still need the Jetson Kit for the physical deployment phase.
  - **Cost:** $700 (One-time purchase).
- **Robot:** You still need one physical robot for the final demo.
  - **Cost:** $3,000 (Unitree Go2 Standard).
