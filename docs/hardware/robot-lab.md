# 3. The Robot Lab

For the "Physical" part of the course, you have three tiers of options depending on budget.

- **Option A: The "Proxy" Approach (Recommended for Budget)**
  - Use a quadruped (dog) or a robotic arm as a proxy. The software principles (ROS 2, VSLAM, Isaac Sim) transfer 90% effectively to humanoids.
  - **Robot:** Unitree Go2 Edu (~$1,800 - $3,000).
  - **Pros:** Highly durable, excellent ROS 2 support, affordable enough to have multiple units.
  - **Cons:** Not a biped (humanoid).

- **Option B: The "Miniature Humanoid" Approach**
  - Small, table-top humanoids.
  - **Robot:** Unitree H1 is too expensive ($90k+), so look at Unitree G1 (~$16k) or Robotis OP3 (older, but stable, ~$12k).
  - **Budget Alternative:** Hiwonder TonyPi Pro (~$600).
  - **Warning:** The cheap kits (Hiwonder) usually run on Raspberry Pi, which cannot run NVIDIA Isaac ROS efficiently. You would use these only for kinematics (walking) and use the Jetson kits for AI.

- **Option C: The "Premium" Lab (Sim-to-Real specific)**
  - If the goal is to actually deploy the Capstone to a real humanoid:
  - **Robot:** Unitree G1 Humanoid.
  - **Why:** It is one of the few commercially available humanoids that can actually walk dynamically and has an SDK open enough for students to inject their own ROS 2 controllers.
