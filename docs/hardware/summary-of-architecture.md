# 4. Summary of Architecture

To teach this successfully, your lab infrastructure should look like this:

| Component | Hardware | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sim Rig | PC with RTX 4080 + Ubuntu 22.04 | Runs Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity, and trains LLM/VLA models. |
| Edge Brain| Jetson Orin Nano | Runs the "Inference" stack. Students deploy their code here. |
| Sensors | RealSense Camera + Lidar | Connected to the Jetson to feed real-world data to the AI. |
| Actuator | Unitree Go2 or G1 (Shared) | Receives motor commands from the Jetson. |

If you do not have access to RTX-enabled workstations, we must restructure the course to rely entirely on cloud-based instances (like AWS RoboMaker or NVIDIA's cloud delivery for Omniverse), though this introduces significant latency and cost complexity.

Building a "Physical AI" lab is a significant investment. You will have to choose between building a physical On-Premise Lab at Home (High CapEx) versus running a Cloud-Native Lab (High OpEx).
