# Hardware Requirements

This course is technically demanding. It sits at the intersection of three heavy computational loads: Physics Simulation (Isaac Sim/Gazebo), Visual Perception (SLAM/Computer Vision), and Generative AI (LLMs/VLA).

Because the capstone involves a "Simulated Humanoid," the primary investment must be in High-Performance Workstations. However, to fulfill the "Physical AI" promise, you also need Edge Computing Kits (brains without bodies) or specific robot hardware.
